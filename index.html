                    Simple Oven-baked Sea bass
                </h2>
                <p>If you're looking for a simple recipe that really preserves the delicate flavor of sea bass, then
                    I highly recommend you
                    try this one. You can try this with other types of fish but my version used a Chilean sea bass.
                    The original recipe came
                    from SparkRecipes and this is my simplified version of it. Enjoy!

                <p>It is just simply delicious & moist. I either make a loaf or put it into muffin cups & make
                    muffins for my kids to grab
                    in the morning on their way to school. Using margarine makes the muffins come out in...

                </h2>
                <p>This is a great recipe for a simple, thin crust pizza. It's from Jim Lahey who now runs a
                    popular NYC pizzeria called Co. If you don't have a
                    pizza
                    stone, this works well in a cast iron skillet. The recipe requires very little time and effort
                    but the dough must be
                    started the day before.

                    Mashed Potato Pancakes

                <p>This recipe was recently submitted to a news group to which I belong. I think it is very good and
                    hope you like it,
                    too. Preparation time in the kitchen is just a few minutes. When the big meal is through, this
                    is a tasty way to use up
                    the mashed potatoes.

                <p>At the request of my lovely 12 year old daughter, I am posting these, one of her favorite foods.
                    We searched for a
