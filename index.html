                    Simple Oven-baked Sea bass
                </h2>
                <p>If you're looking for a simple recipe that really preserves the delicate flavor of sea bass, then
                    I highly recommend you
                    try this one. You can try this with other types of fish but my version used a Chilean sea bass.
                    The original recipe came
                    from SparkRecipes and this is my simplified version of it. Enjoy!

                    in the morning on their way to school. Using margarine makes the muffins come out in...

                    Jim Lahey's No-knead Pizza Margharita
                </h2>
                <p>This is a great recipe for a simple, thin crust pizza. It's from Jim Lahey who now runs a
                    popular NYC pizzeria called Co. The recipe was printed in New York Magazine. If you don't have a
                    pizza
                    stone, this works well in a cast iron skillet. The recipe requires very little time and effort
                    but the dough must be
                    started the day before.

                    Mashed Potato Pancakes
                </h2>
                <p>This recipe was recently submitted to a news group to which I belong. I think it is very good and
                    hope you like it,
                    too. Preparation time in the kitchen is just a few minutes. When the big meal is through, this
                    is a tasty way to use up
                    the mashed potatoes.

                    We searched for a
